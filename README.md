# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here are some ways to contribute.

- Add a feature
- Fix a bug
- Improve or contribute to documentation
- And more...

If you are contributing to this project as part of [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com), please keep in mind that _quality_ is more important that quantity. Correcting a typo or syntax error that you've found is great! But creating a pull request to remove white space or something that is more a _hinerance vs. helping_ does not align with the spirit of Hacktoberfest and may be marked as invalid.

If there are any doubts, questions, etc, please open an issue and we can chat about it! Heck, if you have an idea but aren't sure how to approach it, open an issue anyway and we'll help you through it.

Star this repo and stay tuned for updates.

It's going to be a bumpy ride. :ghost:
