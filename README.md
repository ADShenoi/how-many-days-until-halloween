# How Many Days Until Halloween?

Idk. Let [this page](http://shannoncrabill.com/how-many-days-until-halloween/) do the counting for you!

## Another Update

Well, [Codeland](http://codelandconf.com/) has come in gone but the love for this project remains. I felt great being able to talk about this project in front of a room full of people. The energy was great, the feedback was great and I'm jazzed and ready for Hacktoberfest 2018 

Slides, resources and links relating to my _What I Learned From Managing My First Open Source Project on Github_ talk [can be found here](http://www.shannoncrabill.com/codeland). Stay Spooky!

## Update!

Wow, it's been almost 6 months since the spookiest day of the year and this project is still getting traffic! It's a great feeling. I never expected something that started off as a fun way to practice Javascript would turn into something I'd be so proud of. The success of this project inspired me to want to share my story. In May, I will be speaking at [Codeland](http://codelandconf.com/speakers/shannon-crabill/) about my experience in managing my first open source project on Github. The conference is a few weeks away, my slides are almost done and I couldn't be more exicted! Expect more updates from me in the future!

## About

In the spirit of [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), I posted this project to GitHub with the purpose of giving developers a place to practice write coding and working with Git / Github. You can [read my blog post](https://shannoncrabill.com/blog/hacktoberfest-2017/) for more on how this project came to be.

A list of notable updates for the project are documented in the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
